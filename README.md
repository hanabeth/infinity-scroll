# Infinity Scroll
I created this project to hypnotize myself. 


## About
Do you ever find yourself scrolling through social media to the point where your eyes sting and you aren't fully comprehending the content? This magical experience is possible because of infinity scrolling.


*NOTE*: I am using the free version of Unsplash API so this project can only call the API 50 times per day.

To run the application you will need an unsplash API Key. The agreement is the keep the key confidential, meaning I haven't pushed up my API key nor is this project running on GitHub pages. Click on the photo to be taken to the Unsplash site and see the photographs details.
You can create a key via the [Unsplash Developers](https://unsplash.com/documentation#creating-a-developer-account) page. You will then provide your key at the top of the *index.js* file to the *apiKey* variable.
